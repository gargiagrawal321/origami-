     <b> <i> Camel </i></b> <br>
     <ol>
        <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</li>
        <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
        <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</li>
        <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li>
        <li>Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>

    <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful origami chameleon</b></h4>
    <b> <i> Chameleon </i></b> <br>
    
    <ol>
        <li>A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings – sort of like camouflage. However, this isn’t true.</li>
        <li>Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
        <li>Well, not literally – but they can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!</li>
        <li>59 unique species of chameleon live on the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else. This is over a quarter of the world’s 202 species.</li>
        <li>The largest chameleon by length is the Malagasy giant chameleon, also known as Oustalets’s Chameleon. Some members of this species have been measured at almost 70cm.</li>

    <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful origami pigeon</b></h4>
    <b> <i> pigeon </i></b> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Pigeons have lived alongside man for thousands of years with the first images of pigeons being found by archaeologists in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and dating back to 3000BC.</li>
        <li>The first biblical reference to the pigeon (or dove) was in the Old Testament of the Bible in the first millennium AC and was the story of Noah and the dove of peace.</li>
        <li>Although pigeon guano is seen as a major problem for property owners in the 21st century, it was considered to be an invaluable resource in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries in Europe.</li>
        <li>The earliest large-scale communication network using pigeons as messengers was established in Syria and Persia around the 5th century BC. </li>
        <li>Many religious groups, including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, feed pigeons for religious reasons.</li>

        <h4><b>Some facts of a beautiful origami teddy-bear</b></h4>
        <b> <i> teddy-bear </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The origins of Hug A Bear Day are unclear but it may be connected with the day in November 1902 when Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a hunting trip in Mississippi. </li>
            <li> Actually the hunting trip was on November 14, not November 7. </li>
            <li>The incident of Roosevelt sparing the bear led to the popularity and naming of Teddy bears.</li>
            <li>The story of Goldilocks And The Three Bears was written in 1837 by Robert Southey who was the Poet Laureate at the time. </li>
            <li> In Southey’s original story, the visitor to the bears’ house was an ugly old woman. Goldilocks only entered the tale in later versions. </li>

        <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful origami panda</b></h4>
        <b> <i> Panda </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>
            <li>Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.</li>
            <li>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</li>
            <li>Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful origami cicada</b></h4>
        <b> <i>Flying cicada </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>People call these cicadas “locusts” but they are not true locusts — real locusts look like grasshoppers. The phrase “17 year cicada” indicates that they arrive every 17 years. </li>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
            <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
            <li>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li>
        </ol>
